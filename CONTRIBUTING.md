## Loose Guidelines

- Keep new entries and additions topical and well organized. 

- Remove redundancy and actively police for it.

- Try to avoid single articles especially news articles.

- Avoid review sites unless they are very in-depth or otherwise potentially interesting.

- Please try and find typos and organizational mistakes.

- Use your best judgement, the worst thing that can happen is your pull request gets rejected or needs to be edited.
